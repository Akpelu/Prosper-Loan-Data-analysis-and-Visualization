## by Progress Akpelu


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Before analysing the dataset, i had to do some wrangling. I checked for nulls and duplicates. I had to selected the part of the data i think are important for my analysis. Then after, i converted some of the columns to ordered categorical variables for ease of analysis. Furthermore, Univariate, Bivariate analysis were then carried. Different columns were compared to know the relationship they had on each other.


## Summary of Findings

> In the quest to unravel the factors to consider for the interest rate and annual APR of the borrower, it was shown that for individuals to access the prosper loan, that individual must either be employed or own a home. If the individual is employed, the monthly income as stated on the loan listing is also considered. This is important for the prosper loan to be sure that the individual would pay on time. These factors, employemt status, monthly income and mortage (home in this case) are used for rating and scoring the individual. This score and rating known as ProsperScore and ProsperRating are used to calculate the interest rate and annual APR of the loan collected.
> Our analysis revealed that, prosper score and prosper rating are inversely proportional to the interest rate of the borrower. Meaning that if a borrower's proper score and propser rating are high, the borrower is likely to have a lower interest rate. It also revealed that employed individuals got most of the loans, and they are the majority of those who have paid of their loans or nealy completion.
